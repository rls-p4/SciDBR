Description: A package to interact with SciDB, a database that organizes data in n-dimensional arrays. 
    SciDB arrays consist of a coordinate system whose coordinates are called dimensions, and one or
    more values at each coordinate called attributes.
    SciDB database features include ACID transactions, parallel processing, distributed storage, and 
    efficient sparse array storage. 
    This R package enables running of SciDB queries using native array
    functional language (AFL) and optionally returning results as data frames.
